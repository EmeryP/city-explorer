# City Explorer
The challenge was to build a React front end for a provided Express backend hosted at Heroku.

### Getting Started
Click the `AWS deployed site` link below and enter the name of any city in the world you'd like to explore and we'll grab some data that we think will help you make your travel decision. Be patient with Heroku as it might take 10-20sec to retrieve your results.
